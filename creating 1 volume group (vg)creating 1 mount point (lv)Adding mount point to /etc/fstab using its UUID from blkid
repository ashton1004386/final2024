So when i went to create a volume group and a logical volume , I had to add the mount point to /etc/fstab . I  also had to make the disks ready by initializing them with pvcreate, and then created a volume group using those disks with vgcreate. Then i created a logical volume within that volume group with lvcreate, specifying the size. When the logical volume was created, i had to format it with a filesystem using mkfs.ext4 and mounted it to a directory (e.g., /mnt/data) I used the blkid command to get the UUID of the logical volume and then added an entry to /etc/fstab with the UUID to automatically mount it to the specified directory.
