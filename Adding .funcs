When adding the functions for tux, I created a file called .funcs in the user's home directory. In this file, I defined custom functions like calcit, whdr and wftr. After defining the functions in .funcs, I updated the .bashrc file to automatically load the functions by adding a line that sources the .funcs file. The I used the source ~/.bashrc command to apply the changes, making the functions available.
