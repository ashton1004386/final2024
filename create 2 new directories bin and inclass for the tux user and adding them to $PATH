So I created two new directories, bin and inclass for tux and add them to the $PATH, I  created the directories inside the tux user's home directory using the mkdir command. Then, I updated the tux user's environment by modifying the .bashrc file. In this file, I added a line to include the newly created directories which is (~/bin and ~/inclass) in the $PATH variable, allowing me to run scripts or programs stored in those directories from anywhere in the terminal. After making this change,I used source ~/.bashrc to apply the update.
