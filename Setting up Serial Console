When setting up the serial console, I enabled the serial console service by ensuring that the system would use the serial port for login access. I did this by going in and configuring systemd to start a getty service on the serial port which  would allow me log in through the serial console. I modified the system configuration by creating or editing files to ensure the serial console would start on boot and accept login attempts. After all that i tested the setup by connecting to the serial console.
